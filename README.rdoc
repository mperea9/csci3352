== Welcome to Vax!

Vax is a is a game about epidemic prevention. It's also an interactive learning
environment designed to visualize a process that strains our imagination:

<i>A contagion spreading across a network</i>

Players are tasked to prepare for an outbreak by vaccinating a network that
resembles human social networks. After distributing vaccines, an infectious
outbreak begins to spread and the player is tasked to quell the epidemic by
quarantining individuals at risk of becoming infected.

Vax! is a puzzle-game infused with chance that was inspired by real-world
challenges, infectious disease modeling, and addictively rewarding gameplay.

It was developed by Ellsworth Campbell, a PhD student in the Salath√© Group
at Penn State University. Graphic design by Isaac Bromley. Released under a

== Why did you make Vax?

I wanted Vax to be all of the following, and more...

1. An opportunity to unify two disparate passions: video games and science.
2. A tool to introduce a general audience to concepts related to infectious disease dynamics.
3. A data-driven method to illustrate how contact networks can affect infectious disease dynamics.
4. A widely accessible interactive framework to visualize, simulate, and *experience* an infectious processes spreading across/through a contact network.
5. A platform for a fledgling scientist, such as myself, to gain the experience and skills to do scientific outreach in the digital realm.


== How was Vax built?

Before Vax, the extent of my web development experience is encompassed by this amazing Ruby on Rails tutorial[http://ruby.railstutorial.org]. Therefore this web application is minimalist by-design. I've employed a few libraries, such as d3.js[http://d3js.org], jquery[http://jquery.com], and jqueryui[http://jqueryui.com]. I've also employed a few gems to handle cookies, errors, and styling.
